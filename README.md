Hi there 👋

My name is Lara and I'm junior FullStack Developer from Lisbon 😁.

I have a master degree in civil engineering but i discover that programing was my passion, so this April I graduated from Code for All_'s 95-14 weeks "Full-Stack Programming Bootcamp 🎓 👀. I´m now hoping t enter the market as Full-stack Developer.

I'm a nature🌱 and art passionate 🎨.
